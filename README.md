# My first todo list

I'm attempting to make a nice and reliable todo list in multiple steps no matter how much time it takes. I'll increase its functionality and possibilities gradually untill I'm satisfied

### Now the current version can:

1. Remove tasks
2. Mark tasks as done
3. Save everything to localStorage so that you don't lose the tasks after refreshing the page

Test the app **[here](https://armatura100.github.io/my-todo/)**.
